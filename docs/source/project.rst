In Memoriam
-----------
We acknowledge the loss of our friend and collaborator Stephen Hauskins, a long time staff member of the UCSC ITS and the ITS divisional liaison for Physical and Biological Sciences. Many of us benefitted from Stephen's' technical support for the division, including the Hummingbird computing cluster. The lux project worked closely with Stephen during its formative months, as he lended us his technical expertise enthusiastically. Stephen decommissioned the previous Hyades system, worked with the lux project on the vendor selection for the computer, provided almost daily input into the configuration and management of lux, and was to work with us on the user support going forward. His kindness, expertise, and helpfulness will be greatly missed.
